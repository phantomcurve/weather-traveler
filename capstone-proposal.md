# Project Proposal

### Name: Tim Roth

### Project Name: Weather Traveler

### MVP Features

  * Display weather from multiple locations chosen by user
  * Use API to fetch weather and geolocations of user
  * Styled siteâ€“to visually differentiate between locations and weather patterns

### Tools, Frameworks, Libraries, APIs 

This project will utilize React.js, Node.js, Redux, Firebase/Firestore (with authentication for user customizability), and multpile APIs (Google Geocode and NOAA Weather Data) to achieve its desired functionality. It will also use Bootstrap and other CSS magic to create a visually stunning landscape that immerses the user in their chosen milieu.

### Stretch Goals

  * Go even further with styling and animations
  * Make shareable gifs or screenshots of a user's weather travel palette
  * Create a vibe algorithm to determine the mood of each day of weather forecasted so you know how to feel given the weather and context of surrounding days and time of year.

### Additional Tools Required to Achieve Stretch Goals

Would likely need to employ more APIs and quite a bit more code to achieve the stretch goals mentioned above. I'm not aware of what other libraries or specific tools I would need yet, but these should become very clear as the project begins to take shape.
